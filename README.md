## React-GraphQL-API-Explorer

The intention of this application is to understand the **GraphQL** implementation in client side using libraries like **apollo-client** and **graphql-tag**. I do also enabled the CI-CD using **Github action** and **Firebase Hosting** which will host the application on every commit to the Master branch

## CI-CD for the application
GitHub action is being used to build this application during each commit to the Master Branch and that build package will be deploy in Fireabse
